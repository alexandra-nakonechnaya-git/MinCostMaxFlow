In the modern world of logistics, the task often arises of creating an optimal network for the distribution of products between logistics facilities. This task is a linear programming task. There are several ways to solve this problem:
•	improvement of the iteration transportation plan;
•	solution based on graph theory.
Improving the plan iteratively is possible in three ways:
•	northwest corner method;
•	least cost method;
•	method of potentials.
A typical mathematical representation of a logistics network is the traveling salesman problem, which can be solved by different methods. In this report, the problem is solved not by iteration, but by graph theory. This makes it possible to investigate the problem of completing the graph thanks to the Source and Stoke nodes. The ribs associated with the source and stoke generate supply and demand.
To take into account capacity limitations, bandwidth must be introduced. Therefore, in order to investigate the problem, it is necessary to include the stream component.
The combination of the problems of finding the maximum flow and the minimum path leads to the use of the Ford-Fulkerson algorithm, which is considered in the theory of stream networks.
